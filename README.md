day1:‚úÖ Definition of Linux:

Linux is an open-source, free, and Unix-like operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel, first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It acts as an interface between computer hardware and software, managing resources and enabling users to run applications.

Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, mobile devices (like Android), embedded systems, and supercomputers because of its stability, security, flexibility, and open-source nature.

üêö Shell:

‚û§ Definition:

The Shell is a command-line interface (CLI) or a program that allows users to interact with the operating system. It takes commands from the user, interprets them, and passes them to the Kernel for execution.

‚û§ Functions of Shell:

Takes input from users.

Interprets and translates it into a form the Kernel understands.

Displays the output/result to the user.


‚û§ Types of Shell:

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) ‚Äì Most common

Sh (Bourne Shell)

Csh (C Shell)

Ksh (Korn Shell)

Zsh (Z Shell)


‚û§ Example:

When you type ls in the terminal, the Shell sends this request to the Kernel to list files.

üß† Kernel:

‚û§ Definition:

The Kernel is the core part of the operating system, which directly interacts with the hardware. It manages system resources like CPU, memory, disk, and devices, ensuring that hardware and software communicate correctly.
