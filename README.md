day1:‚úÖ Definition of Linux:

Linux is an open-source, free, and Unix-like operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel, first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It acts as an interface between computer hardware and software, managing resources and enabling users to run applications.

Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, mobile devices (like Android), embedded systems, and supercomputers because of its stability, security, flexibility, and open-source nature.
